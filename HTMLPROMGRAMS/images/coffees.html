    <div id="v" ><h1>         Did You Know ?</h1><br><p>The discovery of coffee dates back to the 9th century. Attributd to an Ethiopian goat herd3er named Kaldi According to the legend kaldi.Wild coffee plants, probably from Kefa (Kaffa), Ethiopia, were taken to southern Arabia and placed under cultivation in the 15th century. The popularity of coffee in the Arab world led to the creation of the coffeehouse, first in Mecca and then in Constantinople in the 15th and 16th centuries, respectively. Ethiopia is widely considered to be the epicentre of where coffee came from. If you've ever googled “coffee history”, you will have come across the famous story of how coffee was founded in Ethiopia by Kaldi, an Ethiopian goat herder, around 800 AD. He wandered over to his goats to see them acting very strangely.</p> <img id="r" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSTuihBB5ScGrkStu4BsUkQvRBXVHXgLD86Bw&s"><hr></div>

    <div class="col col1"><img id="i1" src=" https://img.freepik.com/premium-photo/cup-coffee-is-being-poured-into-cup_81048-5017.jpg"><h2>Black Coffee</h2>It is rich in caffeine that may stimulate the metabolism and increases your energy level, suppressing hunger. Black coffee contains a chlorogenic acid that helps to slow down the production of glucose. Hence, if you drink a black coffee after a meal, it can help to slow down glucose.</div>
    <div class="col col2"><img id="i1" src="https://skinnymixes.co.uk/cdn/shop/articles/Cinnamon_Latte.jpg?v=1684933139"><h2>Cinnamon Coffee</h2>The sweet and woody taste of cinnamon makes it another spice that goes exceptionally well with chocolate. Although slightly sweet, the woody flavour is more prominent and has a subtle yet noticeable impact on every dish it is used in.</div></div>
    <div class="col col3"><img id="i1" src="https://milkandpop.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/mocha-latte-13.jpg"> <h2>Chocolate Coffee</h2>Chocolate coffee, also known as the 'Mocha', is a delightful combination of chocolate and coffee. A mocha is typically based on the combination of an espresso and hot milk with added chocolate flavours, either through cocoa powder or chocolate syrup, and additional sweetener for those with a big sweet-tooth.

The taste of cappuccinos can be described as creamy, smooth, and balanced. The combination of flavors and textures creates a delightful and comforting experience for many coffee enthusiasts.</div>
    <div class="col col5"><img id=i1 src="https://img.pikbest.com/origin/09/42/75/34QpIkbEsTycG.jpg!sw800"><h2>Iced Coffee</h2>Quite simply, an iced coffee is a cold version of your favourite coffee, but it's not simply a coffee that has been left to cool. Like a regular coffee, it's usually a combination of hot espresso and milk. However, ice is added too..</div></div>
    <div class="col col6"><img id="i1" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2023/07/espresso-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg"> <h2>Expresso Coffee</h2>Espresso is thicker and more intense than coffee because of the lower grounds to water ratio, the finer grind, and the pressurized brewing method.
